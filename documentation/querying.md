# Querying The Graph


One of the two purposes of the client library is to make it easy to query the subgraph that contains the index of DAOstack data (the other purpose it to make it easy to write to the DAOstack contracts).

## Query examples:

```
dao.proposals()
arc.sendQuery(`daos { id name }`)
proposals.state()
```
